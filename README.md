# Handwritten Digits Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using **classical Machine Learning models**. The dataset used is **MNIST**, a widely known dataset containing **28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9)**. The goal is to develop and compare different machine learning models to evaluate their classification performance.

## Project Goals
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.
- **Train multiple Machine Learning models** and compare their performance.
- **Visualize and interpret classification results**.

## Dataset Details
- **Source:** [MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset (OpenML)](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=554&sort=runs)
- **Training Samples:** 60,000
- **Testing Samples:** 10,000
- **Format:** Images (28x28 pixels, grayscale)
- **Classes:** 10 (Digits 0-9)
